//Note: Put your classes in the namespace IteratorsAndComparators.
//Extend your solution from the previous task. Inside the Library, create a nested class
//LibraryIterator, which should implement the IEnumerator<Book> interface. Try to implement the
//bodies of the inherited methods by yourself. You will need two more members:
//List<Book> books
//int currentIndex
//Now you should be able to iterate through a Library in the Main method.
